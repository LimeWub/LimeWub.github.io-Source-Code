                    <li>Led back-end development of a number of feature rich, flexible and easy to use PHP based websites, while collaborating closely with the front-end developers and designers as part of a small team.</li>
                    <li>Extended company’s CMS of choice, ProcessWire, with custom functionality as per each website’s needs, in a re-usable modular manner. Most notably, for one of our clients, I developed a secure, full member login and dashboard functionality, including an easily customisable form solution, which supported wizard steps, auto-save features, ajax submissions, multiple regex based validations and secure file uploads; a combination of a PHP7 back-end and jQuery/parsley.js front-end.</li>
                    <li>Tasked with various smaller front-end builds, some of which holding pages for bigger client projects necessitated by tight deadlines, others single pages for larger client websites. These were built to match the exact requirements of their development teams, for integration purposes, and received great feedback and return work as a result.</li>
                    <li>Handled support for some of our long term clients, responding to tickets and feature requests, discussing requirements, managing expectations and implementing new functionality and API integrations.</li>
                    <li>Researched and implemented an array of in-house life improvements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Re-structured the company’s main back-up script to be more stable while using significantly less server space</li>
